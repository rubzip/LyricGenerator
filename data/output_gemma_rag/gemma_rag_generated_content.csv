Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me

All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie

Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possession

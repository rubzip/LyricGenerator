Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me\nThis all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy\nI need somebody to hear,  somebody to know\nSomebody to have, somebody to hold\nIt's easy to say, but it's never the same\nI guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, the day bleeds into nightfall\nAnd you're not here to get me through it all\nI let my guard down and then you pulled the rug\nI was getting kinda used to being someone you loved\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to\nThis all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you\nNow, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear\nSomebody to have, just to know how it feels\nIt's easy to say, but it's never the same\nI guess I kinda like the way you help me escape\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, the day bleeds into nightfall\nAnd you're not here to get me through it all\nI let my guard down and then you pulled the rug\nI was getting kinda used to being someone you loved\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nAnd I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes\nI fall into your arms\nI'll be safe in your sound till I come back around\n\n[Chorus]\nFor now, the day bleeds into nightfall\nAnd you're not here to get me through it all\nI let my guard down and then you pulled the rug\nI was getting kinda used to being someone you loved\nBut now the day bleeds into nightfall\nAnd you're not here to get me through it all\nI let my guard down and then you pulled the rug\nI was getting kinda used to being someone you loved\nI let my guard down and then you pulled the rug\nI was getting kinda used to being someone you loved168Embed", "Before You Go": "103 ContributorsTranslationsEspa\u00f1olDeutschBefore You Go Lyrics[Verse

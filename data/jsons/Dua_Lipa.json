an island, even when you're close\nCan't take the silence, I'd rather be alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could\nIt's time I wave goodbye from the window\nLet's end this like we should and say we're good\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine\nSo let's at least agree to go our separate ways\nNot gonna judge you when you're with somebody else\nAs long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself\nLet's end it like we should and say we're good\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo need to hide it, go get what you want\nThis won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could\nIt's time I wave goodbye from the window\nLet's end this like we should and say we're good\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine\nSo let's at least agree to go our separate ways\nNot gonna judge you when you're with somebody else\nAs long as you swear you

People keep on givin' in\nMakin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends\nNot respectin' each other, deny thy brother\nA war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover\nThe truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug\nIf you never know truth, then you never know love\nWhere's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)\nAnd where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)\nAnd where's the love y'all?\n\n[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]\nPeople killin', people dyin'\nChildren hurtin', hear them cryin'\nCan you practice what you preach?\nAnd would you turn the other cheek?\nFather, father, father, help us\nSend some guidance from above\n'Cause people got me, got me questioning\nWhere is the love?\n[Post-Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]\n(Love) Where is the love?

(Yeah)\nWhatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)\nInstead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)\nLack of understanding leading us away from unity\nThat's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under\nThat's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down\nIt's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under\nGotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found\nNow ask yourself\n[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]\nWhere is the love?\nWhere is the

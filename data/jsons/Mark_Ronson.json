love, our trust\n\n[Chorus: King Princess]\nAll of my love\nSwing and a miss every time that we talk\nAnd now all I got is pieces of us\nOh, how my luck goes down when we talk\nAnd now all I got is pieces of us\n\n[Post-Chorus: King Princess]\nOur love, our trust\nNo matter which way you cut it\nThere's pieces of us\nOur love, our trust\nNo matter which way you cut it\nThere's pieces of

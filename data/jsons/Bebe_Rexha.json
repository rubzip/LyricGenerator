be\nI'm begging you, please\nI'm praying for closed doors and open windows\nI'll follow where the wind blows, don't be scared to leave\nIf I'm not all you need, then just set me free\nI'm down on my knees tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nSet, set, set me free\nLet, let, let me be\nI'm down, down on my knees\n(I'm down, down on my knees)\nSet, set, set me free\nLet, let, let me be\nI'm down, down on my knees\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I'm not all you need, then just set me free\nI'm down on my knees\nIf you're not the one for me, then just let me be\nI'm begging you, please\nI'm praying for closed doors and open windows\nI'll follow where the wind blows, don't be scared to leave\nIf I'm not all you need, then just set me free\nI'm down on my knees tonight18Embed"}

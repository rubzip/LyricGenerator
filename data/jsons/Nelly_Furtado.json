I'm ready for you this time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nJust a little look has got me feeling things (Yeah)\nJust a little touch has got me seeing things (Yeah)\nJust a little taste has got me off the chains\nDoing things that I don't wanna do\n\n[Chorus]\nDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)\nDo it like you do it to me (It's not enough)\nDo it like you do it to me (Just open up)\nDon't you know how much I want you\nDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)\nDo it like you do it to me (It's not enough)\nDo it like you do it to me (Just open up)\nDon't you know how much I want you\n\n[Bridge]\nWe're sitting real close, I can feel your breath\nI wanna touch your hand, but I lay back (Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah)\nWe're sitting real close, I can feel your breath\nI wanna touch your hand, I cannot fight it off\n(D-d-d-d-do it, do it, do it)\n[Chorus]\nDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)\nDo it like you do it to me (It's not enough)\nDo it like you do it to me (Just open up)\nDon't you know how much I want you\nDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)\nDo it like you do it to me (It's not enough)\nDo it like you do it to me (Just open up)\nDon't you know how much I want you\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah\nY-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah\nYeah, yeah\nY-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah\nYeah, yeah2Embed"}

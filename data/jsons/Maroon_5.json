breath you breathe\nI see there's somethin' goin' on\nI don't understand why you're so cold\n\n[Verse 1: Adam Levine]\nAre we taking time or a time out?\nI can't take the in-between\nAsking me for space here in my house\nYou know how to fuck with me\nActing like we're not together\nAfter everything that we've been through\nSleeping up under the covers\nHow am I so far away from you?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nDistant, when we're kissing\nFeel so different\nBaby, tell me how did you get so\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nCold enough to chill my bones\nIt feels like I don't know you anymore\nI don't understand why you're so cold to me\nWith every breath you breathe\nI see there's somethin' goin' on\nI don't understand why you're so cold, yeah\nSee Maroon 5 LiveGet tickets as

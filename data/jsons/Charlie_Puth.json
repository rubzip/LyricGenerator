one\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou took away a year (Took away a year)\nOf my fuckin' life\nAnd I can't get it back no more\nSo when I see those tears (When I see those tears)\nComin' out your eyes\nI hope it's me they're for\n\n[Chorus]\nYou didn't love when you had me\nBut now you need me so badly\nYou can't be serious (Ha-ha-ha)\nThat's hilarious (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)\nThinkin' I would still want you\nAfter the things you put me through\nYeah, you're delirious (Ha-ha-ha, you're delirious)\nThat's hilarious (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, that's hilarious)\nYou didn't love when you had me\nBut now you need me so badly\nYou can't be serious (You can't be serious, ha-ha-ha)\nThat's hilarious (That's hilarious, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)\nThinkin' I would still want you\nAfter the things you put me through\nYeah, you're delirious (You're delirious, ha-ha-ha)\nThat's hilarious (That's hilarious, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)\n[Outro]\n(Ha-ha-ha)\n(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)39Embed"}

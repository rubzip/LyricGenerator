fountain\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in\nKissing her lips, and whispering in her ear\nAnd she knows that she shouldn't listen\nAnd that she should be with me by the water fountain\n\n[Chorus]\nShe couldn't be at home in the night time because\nIt made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young\nI was too young\nI should've built a home with a fountain for us\nThe moment that she told me that she was in love\nToo young, I was too young\nToo young, too young, too young, young\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if she ever goes back to the water fountain\nThe handle will be broken and the rust set in\nBut my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it\nMy heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nNow I'm grabbing her hips, and

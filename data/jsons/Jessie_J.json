yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate that I let you down\nAnd I feel so bad about it\nI guess karma comes back around\n'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah\nAnd I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken\nDon't tell me you can't forgive me\n'Cause nobody's perfect, no\nAnd I hate that I let you down\nAnd I feel so bad about it\nI guess karma comes back around\n'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah\nAnd I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken\nDon't tell me you can't forgive me\n'Cause nobody's perfect, yeah, yeah, whoa\n\n[Outro]\nDon't tell me, don't tell, don't tell me you can't forgive me\nNo, no, no, no\n'Cause nobody's perfect, no14Embed"}

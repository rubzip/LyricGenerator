you'll be lonely\"\nOnce, I was seven years old\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger\nPushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker\nBy eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor\nNever rich, so we were out to make that steady figure\n\n[Chorus]\nOnce, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me\n\"Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely\"\nOnce, I was eleven years old\n\n[Verse 2]\nI always had that dream like my daddy before me\nSo I started writing songs, I started writing stories\nSomething about that glory just always seemed to bore me\n'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me\n\n[Chorus]\nOnce, I was twenty years old, my story got told\nBefore the morning sun, when life was lonely\nOnce, I was

are with me, some are still out seeking glory\nAnd some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry\n\n[Chorus]\nSoon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one\nRemember life and then your life becomes a better one\nI made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once\nI hope my children come and visit once or twice a month\n[Breakdown]\nSoon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?\nOr will I have a lot of children who can warm me?\nSoon, I'll be sixty years old\nSoon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?\nOr will I have a lot of children who

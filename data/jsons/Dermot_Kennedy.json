found a moment to be brave, so I let her know\nAnd she said, \"How could I love you back?\nYou who dropped your dreams in the gutter\"\nAnd in my winter, she'll be burning slow\nFeels like December

Evening I Will Not Forget (Acoustic)": "18 ContributorsAn Evening I Will Not Forget (Acoustic) LyricsWhen love was found\nI kept my hope just like I'd hoped to\nThen sang to the sea for feelings deep blue\nAnd coming down\nAnd we've had problems that we've grown through\nBut I bet you dream of what you could do\nAt seventeen, I was alright\nWas like nothing I could feel inside\nAnd wishing you were here tonight is like holding on\nBut I still get to see your face, right?\nAnd that's like nothing they can take, right?\nSo there won't be no feeling in the firelight\nHoping this'll be right\nTime to show your worth, child\nI remember when her heart broke over stubborn shit\nThat's no way to be living kid\nThe angel of death is ruthless\nAnd I'm always thinking summertime with the bikes out\nPushing our luck, getting wiped out\nDays with nothing but laughing loud\nUnderneath my coat, won't you tap my shoulder, hold my hand\nNights with nothing but dark in there\nYou could be my armor then\nIsland smiles and cardigans\nThe nights that we've been drinking in\nWe're here to help you kill all of this hurt that you've been harboring\nConfessions should be better planned\nAlone, that night, I'm surely damned\nRun away,. I'll understand\nWhat's important is this evening I will not forget\nPurple, blue, orange, red\nThese colors of feeling, give me love, I'll put my heart in it\nAnd I think about it all the time\nLights went out, you were fine\nYou kinda struggle not to shine\nI still love you, though\nI still love you, though\nI still love you always\nSo hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long\nCrack and break and part ways\nI still love you, though\nI still love you, though\nI still love you always\nSo hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long\nLet's not crack and break and part ways\nAnd I wonder if I could let her down\nIt's for real, it's for real\nIt's for real, it's for realYou might also like9Embed", "A Closeness": "14 ContributorsA Closeness Lyrics[Verse 1]\nKeeping

the past being cruel\nGot a thought for those who start to think of love\nAs the pursuit of a fool, it's a palace from ruin\nDeep into the night, eyes closing\nHeart swollen with my loving for you\nA solid embrace, kind face\nAnd then the hurt starts leaving the room, followed by goons\nSometimes it's open wide and lights the road at night\nYou've got a heart like the moon\nGather courage, if

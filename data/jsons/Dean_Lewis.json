reach for your hand but it's cold\nYou pull away again\nAnd I wonder what's on your mind\nAnd then you say to me you made a dumb mistake\nYou start to tremble and your voice begins to break\nYou say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's\nThey were my mate's\nAnd I feel the colour draining from my face\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd my friend said\n\"I know you love her, but it's over, mate\nIt doesn't matter, put the phone away\nIt's never easy to walk away, let her go\nIt'll be alright\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I still look back at all the messages you'd sent\nAnd I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head\nAnd everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone\nAnd when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on\nBut it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday\nIt's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake\nAnd everything I know tells me that I should walk away\nBut I just wanna stay\nSee Dean Lewis LiveGet tickets as low as $86You

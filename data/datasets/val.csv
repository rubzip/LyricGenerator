'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there, because
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea

I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves

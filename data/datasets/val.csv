Demi Lovato,Lonely,[Verse 3: Lil Wayne],"Bitch, can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there, because
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fucking lonely, yeah",[Verse]

Just hold me, I'm lonely",[Pre-Chorus]
Demi Lovato,Stone Cold,[Chorus],"Happy for you

Dermot Kennedy,For Island Fires and Family,[Verse 2],"Now wasn't it love soon as we knew each other properly?
Livin' 'bout half right 'til a certain person got to me
Nothin' is secret, everythin's sacred, how it ought to be
Under the moonlight on a clear night
On rooftops is where I want to be
Sometimes I'm like a child, that's somethin' I can't release
Dreams of her comin' home, sweet home
And I'm tellin' you, home is so sweet
Said you reminded me of the summertime, and I still mean that
In a full room, I'm the only one she's smilin' at
So wouldn't you let me know if you were thinkin' less of me?
That's what she asked me
What was promised, what we both agreed
But truthfully, if you ever go
You'll drop me straight to Hell, the 7th circle
And I was talkin' with you earlier
We were open and vulnerable, it was wonderful
I, I used to dream that you would talk to me
I used to dream that you would talk to me

She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance",[Verse]

To get the people going dumb and insane
Hundred thousand people going bonkers in the mud and the rain

Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],[Verse 3],"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [Live Acoustic],[Verse 4],"They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""",[Verse]

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah",[Chorus]

Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no",[Bridge]

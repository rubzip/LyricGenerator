So I'm thankful for my sister, even though sometimes we fight
When high school wasn't easy, she's the reason I survived

On the Westside of the city, next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made

With each other, and though some times were hard
Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart
No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end
Their love was stronger than
The day that they first met
They'd say",[Verse ]

All her words are empty when she denies
That she can feel them bending
All their love is pending, so what is she defending?
But she'd be fine preten—

Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?",[Verse]

Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],[Verse 4],"They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""",[Verse ]

Maybe it's the fast life
Maybe it's the limousines
Maybe it's the good weed
Maybe it's the nicotine
Maybe she's a dancer
Maybe she's a beauty queen
All these cars and clothes and calories
All these, cars and clothes and calories, yeah",[Chorus]
blackbear,​chateau,[Verse],"Yeah, suite 23 at the Chateau
Had a heart, man, I'm tryna get it back though
Tryna get it back, tryna get it back, tryna get it back
Age 25 and I'm rich now
No excuse, you be actin' like a bitch now
I gave you diamond, a pool, write the checklist
She want a ring, ain't fucking with a necklace
I'm a fool for these thangs with the big butts
Take a homebody, turn her to a rich slut
Feel like I can't trust nobody, even day ones
Watch out for them snake ones",[Verse]

Call my mama, always drama, she need money for them kids
Another tour, another war, I sold my soul, I hit a lick
If I die and go to hell, I swear to God, I'm gon' be pissed
I've been prayin', I'm just sayin', keep my hands clean off that sin
I've been prayin' layin' in a bed I fucked a hundred in
I've been prayin' they won't find me laying somewhere in a ditch
Got some best friends that I lost 'cause shit I did when I was lit",[Verse ]

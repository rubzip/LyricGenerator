There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
Then push away the unimaginable

And learn to live with the unimaginable
I spend hours in the garden

I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before",[Verse]

We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah",[Pre-Chorus]
benny blanco,Eastside,[Chorus: Khalid],"We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
You might also like",[Chorus]
benny blanco,Eastside,[Verse 2: Halsey],"Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love",[Verse]
benny blanco,Eastside,[Pre-Chorus: Halsey],"He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing",[Pre-Chorus]
benny blanco,Eastside,[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid],"We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me",[Chorus]
benny blanco,Eastside,[Bridge: Halsey & Khalid],"Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now",[Bridge]
benny blanco,Eastside,[Outro: Halsey & Khalid],"He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set",[Outro]
blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Intro],"Yeah
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, yeah
Hey",[Intro]
blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Verse 1],"If I could I would feel nothing, that's the truth and I don't care
Mix prescriptions with prescriptions, it's not right but life's not fair
Ridin' next to me in droptop, wearin' croptop, that's bad, bitch
All designer when we go out just so people know we rich
Underneath it all, the truth is that I really feel like shit
I'm so sick of being tired, I'm so tired of being sick
I ain't never killed nobody, I ain't never sold a brick
Got some OGs that once told me keep my nose clean but I sniff",[Verse]
blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Chorus],"'Cause if I could I would feel nothing
That's the truth and I don't care, baby
That's the truth and I don't care
Mix the Henny with these pills
The world is cold and life's not fair, baby
The world is cold and life's not fair",[Chorus]
blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Post-Chorus],"So let's just fuck, no strings attached
Let's just fuck and after that, I'ma take you home
And you won't call me on the phone
It's all good, I wanted that
It's all good, I wanted that
No feelings, no strings attached, girl
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Yeah

blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Verse 2],"February, weather's scary, I need notes on how to live
Call my mama, always drama, she need money for them kids
Another tour, another war, I sold my soul, I hit a lick
If I die and go to hell, I swear to God, I'm gon' be pissed
I've been prayin', I'm just sayin', keep my hands clean off that sin
I've been prayin' layin' in a bed I fucked a hundred in
I've been prayin' they won't find me laying somewhere in a ditch
Got some best friends that I lost 'cause shit I did when I was lit",[Verse]
blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Chorus],"'Cause if I could I would feel nothing
That's the truth and I don't care, baby
That's the truth and I don't care
Mixed prescriptions, bad decisions
World is cold and life's not fair, baby
World is cold and life's not fair",[Chorus]
blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Outro],"I'm gon' make you fall for me
You'll never get a call from me
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
No feelings, no strings attached, girl
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
It's all good I wanted that
No feelings, no strings attached
No feelings, no strings attached, girl",[Outro]

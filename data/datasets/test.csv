Alec Benjamin,Boy In The Bubble,[Verse 1],"It was 6:48, I was walking home
Stepped through the gate, and I'm all alone
I had chicken on the plate, but the food was cold
Then I covered up my face so that no one knows
I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
When my mom walked into the living room
She said, ""Boy, you gotta tell me what they did to you""
I said, ""You don't wanna know the things I had to do""
She said, ""Son, you gotta tell me why you're black and blue""
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble",[Verse ]

Alec Benjamin,Boy In The Bubble,[Chorus],"Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen

Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer

Alec Benjamin,Boy In The Bubble,[Verse 3],"It was 6:48, he was walking home
With the blood on his hands from my broken nose
But like every other day, he was scared to go
Back to his house 'cause his pops was home
Drowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles
Just looking for trouble
Well, there's no excuse for the things he did
But there's a lot at home that he's dealing with
Because his dad's been drunk since he was a kid
And I hope one day that he'll say to him
""Put down those bubbles and that belt buckle
In this broken bubble""",[Verse ]

But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face

Our love lives on",[Verse ]

Kelly Clarkson,It’s Quiet Uptown,[Verse 1],"There are moments that the words don't reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
Then push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
Feels easier to just swim down
And so they move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before",[Verse ]
Kelly Clarkson,It’s Quiet Uptown,[Chorus],"If you see him in the street, walking by himself
Talking to himself, have pity

You knock me out, I fall apart

And that would be enough
I don't pretend to know

Alec Benjamin,If We Have Each Other,[Verse 1],"She was 19 with a baby on the way
On the EastSide of the city, she was working every day
Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake
She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
And 'cross town she would take the bus at night
To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light
She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright
She was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive",[Verse ]
Alec Benjamin,If We Have Each Other,[Verse 2],"They were 90 and were living out their days
On the Westside of the city, next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made
And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed
With each other, and though some times were hard
Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart
No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end
Their love was stronger than
The day that they first met
They'd say",[Verse ]

We were running riot
Crazy that some people still deny it
Think I’m addicted to my phone
My scrolling horror show
I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome
One tab along, it's pornographic
Everybody's at it
No surprise we're so easily bored
Let's pick the truth that we believe in
Like a bad religion
Tell me all your original sins
So many questionable choices
We love the sound that our voice makes
Man, this echo chamber's getting loud
We're gonna choose the blue pill
We’re gonna close the curtains
We’re gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now
She's gonna flip some tables
I’m gonna move this tale on
We're gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now
We'll be the proud remainers
Here 'til the morning breaks us
We run away from real life thoughts tonight
We’re gonna Peter Pan out
Fade to the close-up, arms 'round
We're gonna stay naive tonight, night, night

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all",[Verse]

As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder

Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity

New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?",[Verse]

All my friends, I'd love to stay
Some summer night, I hope I see you again",[Chorus]
Dermot Kennedy,All My Friends,[Bridge],"So I think of the things that it taught me
She starts to think evil has lost me
I walked with the wolves and it haunts me
She steps with intention to run free

When dancing in ballrooms, you will lead
Promise you'll smile off a memory",[Bridge]

I learned that there's beauty I can't keep

Angry and seething as the sea
Songs in cathedrals in month three
Promise you'll smile off a memory",[Verse ]
Dermot Kennedy,For Island Fires and Family,[Verse 2],"Now wasn't it love soon as we knew each other properly?
Livin' 'bout half right 'til a certain person got to me
Nothin' is secret, everythin's sacred, how it ought to be
Under the moonlight on a clear night
On rooftops is where I want to be
Sometimes I'm like a child, that's somethin' I can't release
Dreams of her comin' home, sweet home
And I'm tellin' you, home is so sweet
Said you reminded me of the summertime, and I still mean that
In a full room, I'm the only one she's smilin' at
So wouldn't you let me know if you were thinkin' less of me?
That's what she asked me
What was promised, what we both agreed
But truthfully, if you ever go
You'll drop me straight to Hell, the 7th circle
And I was talkin' with you earlier
We were open and vulnerable, it was wonderful
I, I used to dream that you would talk to me
I used to dream that you would talk to me

Get it a couple times a year
But I've been gettin' it more often with her

What if I'm lost now 'cause of demons comin'

About a Galway Girl and a perfect night",[Verse ]

Halsey,Nightmare,[Verse 1],"I've tasted blood and it is sweet

And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors",[Verse ]

All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie

Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love",[Verse ]

The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do

If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch

Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks

Let's review:
You took a rumor a few, maybe two, people knew and refuted it by sharing an affair of which no one has accused you
I begged you to take a break, you refused to
So scared of what your enemies will do to you
You're the only enemy you ever seem to lose to

Lin-Manuel Miranda,The Hamilton Mixtape,[Verse 2],"When he was 10, his father split
Full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother, bed-ridden
Half-dead, sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick
And Alex got better but his mother went quick
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride
Somethin' new inside
A voice saying Alex, you gotta fend for yourself
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
There would've been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He would've been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and other things he can't afford
Scannin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future, see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom
His enemies destroyed his rep, America forgot him
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him",[Verse ]

Lin-Manuel Miranda,The Hamilton Mixtape,[Verse 1],"How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore
And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot
In the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther
By workin' a lot harder
By bein' a lot smarter
By bein' a self-starter
By fourteen they had placed him in charge of the trade and charter
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered
And carted away across the waves
Our Hamilton kept his guard up
Inside he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg steal borrow or barter
Then a hurricane came and
Devastation reigned and
Our man saw his future drip drippin' down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple
Connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain
A testament to his pain
Well the word got around, they said, ""This kid is insane, man!""
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
Getcha education, don't forget from whence you came
And the world is gonna know your name!

And that Rolls truck and that paint job real wicked
Used to dumb, dumb myself down for these chickens
Now when dumb-dumb talk, I smile, it be crickets
Boom, I turn every head when I walk in the room
Pretty in real life, hit my pics with the zoom
A ten when they rate her like tomb
Elevator to the penthouse, we ain't stoppin' anytime soon",[Verse]

""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well",[Verse ]

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave

Cover the basics, it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations",[Verse ]

Did you let him leave a necklace? (Yup)

Just to give a little confidence?
I think you know it's time to let go

Dip it low, I'll give you what you want
You can be my Christina Milian from 2004
I hope that was okay, yeah?
I ain't playin', I'm for real
Uh, yuh
I wanna make a request, I wanna feel blessed
I wanna get you out of that dress
It's all about the way that you move
To make a man wanna spend it on you
Work hard, play hard, that's what you do
And baby love, Miss Independent
Could do it on her own, but she feels like a princess
That's alright, 'cause she takes the crown
Yeah, when she, uh

Alessia Cara,Scars to Your Beautiful,[Verse 1],"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But",[Verse ]

God knows what is real and what is fake
Last couple years have been a mad trip
How'd y’all look so perfect?
You must have some portraits in the attic
We'll stay offline so no one gets hurt
Hiding from the real world
Just don't read the comments ever, ever
We fucked this house up like the planet
We were running riot
Crazy that some people still deny it
Think I’m addicted to my phone
My scrolling horror show
I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome
One tab along, it's pornographic
Everybody's at it
No surprise we're so easily bored
Let's pick the truth that we believe in
Like a bad religion
Tell me all your original sins
So many questionable choices
We love the sound that our voice makes
Man, this echo chamber's getting loud
We're gonna choose the blue pill
We’re gonna close the curtains
We’re gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now
She's gonna flip some tables
I’m gonna move this tale on
We're gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now
We'll be the proud remainers
Here 'til the morning breaks us
We run away from real life thoughts tonight
We’re gonna Peter Pan out
Fade to the close-up, arms 'round
We're gonna stay naive tonight, night, night

Free your inner soul and break away from tradition

Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south",[Verse]

The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK

Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah

With the way that you spoke here

Isn't she all of us pining for that last kiss
A permanent truth, a means to get through
Maybe we'll cry whilst hopeful when we think about the past being cruel
Got a thought for those who start to think of love
As the pursuit of a fool, it's a palace from ruin
Deep into the night, eyes closing
Heart swollen with my loving for you
A solid embrace, kind face
And then the hurt starts leaving the room, followed by goons
Sometimes it's open wide and lights the road at night
You've got a heart like the moon
Gather courage, if you're doing something, do it
'Cause she got to go soon",[Verse ]

If I could now, if I could now
If I could now, if I could now",[Chorus]

And catch a cold heart staring at the water, babe, remember you flew",[Verse ]

Under the moonlight on a clear night

Sometimes I'm like a child, that's somethin' I can't release
Dreams of her comin' home, sweet home
And I'm tellin' you, home is so sweet
Said you reminded me of the summertime, and I still mean that
In a full room, I'm the only one she's smilin' at
So wouldn't you let me know if you were thinkin' less of me?
That's what she asked me
What was promised, what we both agreed
But truthfully, if you ever go
You'll drop me straight to Hell, the 7th circle
And I was talkin' with you earlier

Full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother, bed-ridden
Half-dead, sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick
And Alex got better but his mother went quick
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride
Somethin' new inside
A voice saying Alex, you gotta fend for yourself
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
There would've been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He would've been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and other things he can't afford
Scannin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future, see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom
His enemies destroyed his rep, America forgot him
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him",[Verse ]

By workin' a lot harder
By bein' a lot smarter
By bein' a self-starter
By fourteen they had placed him in charge of the trade and charter
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered
And carted away across the waves
Our Hamilton kept his guard up
Inside he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg steal borrow or barter
Then a hurricane came and
Devastation reigned and
Our man saw his future drip drippin' down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple
Connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain
A testament to his pain
Well the word got around, they said, ""This kid is insane, man!""
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland

And the world is gonna know your name!

Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me? (Fall for a woman, for a woman like me)",[Chorus]

Damn it, I hope we all make it somehow

Damn it, my stage show can light up the clouds
Now I'm gonna blow it until I go out

Just the funerals that follow death and some more pain
We're drinking beers and we're lighting up joints in the cold rain

Tryna sit still, keep looking at the main aim
Always doing me so I have to maintain

Got some plaques on the wall and I'm still dope
I'm just trying to show the people that there's still hope
You buy a album and we serve up a meal bro
The label's like ""That's gonna cost you a mill bro""

See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it",[Chorus]
Mike Posner,We Own It (Remix),[Verse 3: Sammy Adams],"I got them wetter than a Vilbrequin youngest of the champions
Beach house music, cue the dark pads and violins
Clear glass out in Malibu with all my friends
Me, Mike Pos, the Mills, and Niykee for the win
I'm growing up I gotta buzz call it motivation
Blowing up like iPhone push notifications
Priceless if I had it back I wouldn't change a thing
It's far from over so I tell the fat lady sing
And she hitting the notes and I'm starting to feel
Like I can't sit in coach cause I get fucking killed
Oh, I own it, oh oh, I'm on it
Cold like Winterfell I Game of Throne it
Hold it, hold it, did anybody notice
They all in the D now, Beantown we own it
Shouts to the D.O. Beantown we roll it
Yeah me and my Gs and we own it, yeah Sammy",[Verse]
Mike Posner,We Own It (Remix),[Verse 2: T. Mills],"I bought it, I own it
You borrow, I loan it
I got people rocking clothes with my fucking name on it
She said ""Milli do your thing""
So I built a stage on it, now my bed rocking
Rocking like one of my shows
All she wearing is perfume, she love my cologne
And I been waiting on my moment what feel like forever
But the more I think about it shit it's probably better
Cause I keep working, I keep grinding, I keep writing, I keep rhyming
I'mma turn a single stone into a pile of diamonds
I remember when I didn't have the funds to buy shit
Holla if that's something that you can identify with
But now I drop a grip on the jeans
And now I drop your rent on some weed
And now I'm making love on your sheets
I'm in your worst nightmare and in your girlfriend's dreams
Wake up, hello, tell me what you see
I'm a skinny motherfucker like six foot three
I said fuck a weight room, I was selling CD's
Getting more pussy than the whole football team
I was born in Riverside and I'm still that
Yeah I heard your new shit and it's still wack
Every time we get together you gonna feel that
This summer and the next, I'mma kill that, Mills",[Verse]

So I could see what you did October 13th
At 10:15, were you really asleep?
Were you lyin' to me and the family?
There's no ""us"" in us when I'm lackin' trust
You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me
Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down?
Don't say sorry now
And thanks to you, I, I can't love right
I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit
Please fuckin' fix this
'Cause you were all I looked up to
Now I can't even look at you",[Verse]

You'll say, ""How's your family? How's your sister?""
I'll say, ""Shannon's bein' Shannon""

Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],[Verse 3],"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

I remember it all too well",[Verse ]

blackbear,​if i could i would feel nothing,[Verse 1],"If I could I would feel nothing, that's the truth and I don't care
Mix prescriptions with prescriptions, it's not right but life's not fair
Ridin' next to me in droptop, wearin' croptop, that's bad, bitch
All designer when we go out just so people know we rich
Underneath it all, the truth is that I really feel like shit
I'm so sick of being tired, I'm so tired of being sick
I ain't never killed nobody, I ain't never sold a brick
Got some OGs that once told me keep my nose clean but I sniff",[Verse ]
